# Useful @code extentions for Angular developers

My IDE of choice is visual studio code.
I love it because of it lightweight and fast boot up.

But its real power comes with the plugins available for every needs.

Here are my favorite plugins to speed up my daily dev work.

## Lint

First of all, as a JavaScript developer a must have plugin is <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESlint</a>.
It's a plugin to check your code against rules and protect you from common error.
Same goes for HTML and CSS. Therefor I have <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkaufman.HTMLHint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTMLHint</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raymondcamden.CSSLint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSSLint</a> installed.

## Git

While vscode is very powerfull connectet to git, there is no way to see the git history.
For that i use <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git History</a>.
So you can see the git log and git history.

In some cases, there is no connection between Jira and your Git Repo. So I wrote a plugin to put a commit message as a Jira ticket comment.
It's called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=web-dave.jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vsc-jira</a>.

## Helper

As a Web Developer and Angular Developer I use a lot of snippets and helper to make my daily work easy done.
First of all I highly recommend <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rbbit.typescript-hero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript Hero</a> to manage all lint, snippets and auto import in ts files.

Another very important plugin is <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular Language Service</a>. It gives you Angular specific linting and intellisense.

That are my favorite plugins.

A buildin functionality I love is <a href="https://emmet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMMET</a>. Please check out the website. I allways demonstrate it in my Workshops.

Feel free to make some recommentions too.
